A simple HTTP Server
====================

A simple HTTP server writing in Java using only low level functionnalities of
the language. The aim was just to dig a little deeper into how HTTP connections
are handled by writing a very simple HTTP handler.

Note: this repository is already an Eclipse project (made with Eclim) it can
therefore be imported by most IDEs as such.
